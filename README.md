# DAAD WISE 2024 Internship â€“ RaspberryPi integration with UAV for GPS and LiteVNA Data Integration  

This internship project focused on optimizing antenna placement on UAVs by performing S-parameter measurements and integrating GPS data for synchronized flight analysis.

---

## Project Overview

- Conducted S11 and S21 (S-parameter) measurements on UAVs using Vivaldi antennas to optimize antenna placement and reduce structural interference.
- Developed scripts for integrating GPS data with measurement logs, enabling synchronized data acquisition triggered by MAVLink commands from QGroundControl.
- Built a Raspberry Pi-based system to capture GPS and measurement data in real-time during flight for later post-processing and analysis.

## Important Notes

- The LiteVNA-related measurement code is **redacted** as it was not authored by me and cannot be publicly shared.
- The repository contains the GPS integration and Raspberry Pi data acquisition scripts developed during the internship.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (pymavlink, csv)
- Raspberry Pi (real-time data logging setup)
- MAVLink protocol and QGroundControl (for UAV communication and command triggering)
- Vivaldi antennas and UAV hardware for measurement

---

## How to Use

1. Deploy the Raspberry Pi data acquisition scripts to your UAV hardware setup.
2. Use the Python scripts to synchronize GPS and measurement data during flight, triggered by MAVLink commands.
3. Perform post-flight analysis using the logged data.
